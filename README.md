This is a webpage where you can play against your friends in the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

This is a nice little side project.

## How to play?
When going on the webpage either on https://arisamiga.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe or your localhost you press on the `Start Game` Button and you will see the previous letters disappear.

Then a indication message will appear on the bottom of the screen showing who's turn it is. 

It will also show if a person has won or if it ended in a draw.

To restart the Tic Tac Toe Game simply press on the `Reset` Button
